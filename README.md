How can we use human-computer interactions to enhance our spatial experiences?

Completed in the Fall 2021 semester at Columbia University GSAPP, this project is an attempt to push the boundaries of the architectural pedagogy and explore human-computer interaction through spatial experience. In partnership with Karan Matta, Kylie Walker, and Takashi Honzawa, we explore the meaning of telepresence.
